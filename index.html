		<h2 class="head"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_video_games">Here</a> is a comprehensive breakdown on the history of video games.</h2>
		<p class="paragraph" id="last">A note about the above link...It does a lot of things well (it has to, it's wikipedia). Looking at the source code, despite the numerous amount of lines and things in there that I don't understand, there was plenty that stood out that I did understand. I could see where the divs divided up all of the different sections of the website, where the tables started and ended, etc. I think the biggest part about what makes it good is how organized it is. It's all sectioned off properly and there is a lot of indenting to differentiate different lines and sections within blocks. It's very well done.</p>
